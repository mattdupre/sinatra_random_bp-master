<div id="apDiv1">          Born and raised in Naperville, IL (voted Money Magazines best place to live in 2006, in case you didn't know) I left the incubator after high school for adventures in college at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Some genius built the campus on the border of two towns, so now they have to use both names in the school name, which is just irritating and they should pick only one or merge the two towns into one town called Chambana. Regardless, I finished my prestigious four year degree and was handed a diploma one day, which I subsequently had framed and mounted, and the next day a pair of gold bars as I became an officer in the Marine Corps. I spent the next five years in service to country and had the rare and exquiste opportunity to visit such beautiful countries as Afghanistan, the Republic of Georgia, and the United Arab Emirates. The time in between these trips I lived in the swampy backwater regions along the little known and infrequently visited southeast coast of North Carolina. Around the midpoint of 2012, I decided that it was time to move on. So I departed the military at the end of July that year and two months later moved back home to Chicago. Since then I've been living, learning, and letting life happen. Que sera sera.</div>
